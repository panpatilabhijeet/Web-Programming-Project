<H2 class=xyz1>The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>
The Apple iPhone 5S is a performance upgrade to the Apple iPhone 5. It features a first in class 64 bit A7 processor which ramps up processing performance several notches higher and also features a revolutionary touch id feature, which might well change the way a number of actions are executed with mobile devices. But apart from these there are very few noteworthy updates in the Apple iPhone 5S.

The iPhone 5S is a performance enhanced upgrade to the iPhone 5 with not much of changes to the chasis which was introduced with the iPhone 5. Apple follows a tradition of releasing one phone a year which is again followed by a performance enhanced 's' update. The Apple iPhone 5S is precisely that. An update which doesnot look much different but has significantly improved performance. While during the same launch event, the Apple iPhone 5C  was promoted as an Apple first entry level iPhone, no such Apple first claims were made for the Apple iPhone 5S. The iPhone 5S has been promoted as precisely what it is, an expensive, top of the line smartphone from Apple, with very few hardware and design upgrades but with numerous performance upgrades and a revolutionary touch id.
</p>

<h2 class=xyz1>Design and Build:</h2>
<p>
The iPhone 5S is built upon a similar chasis as the Apple iPhone 5. Therefore it sports a similar lightweight build, which makes it easy to carry around while at the time doesnot make it lose its luxuriant premium feel. The iPhone 5S still retains similar display size as its predecessor with no move by Apple to bring out a larger than 5 inched display sporting iPhone. As a result the iPhone 5S is easy to hold and carry around. Along with the in phone design, the Apple iPhone 5S also comes with protective leather cases designed and sold by Apple, which come in 5 color tones.
</p>
 

<h2 class=xyz1>Camera Performance:</h2>
<p>
Apple has continued with its regular updation of the camera sensor with every new release and the iPhone 5S is no different. The sensor size has been increased and as a result the iSight camera is somewhat similar to the HTC One's  camera. Apple has largely focused upon getting better pictures with a low light environment. And to do so, the iPhone 5S sports a faster aperture, in order to increase the light inflow. With the new A7 processor that is in the iPhone 5S, Apple has also packed in a new custom Image Signal Processor (ISP), which allows better clarity while resolving the images.
</p>
 

<h2 class=xyz1>Display:</h2>
<p>
The display on the Apple iPhone 5S is a 4 inch retina display similar to the one sported by the Apple iPhone 5. While the retina display provides one of the most clean interfaces in use around, still the 1136 x 640 resolution falls at the low end of what most present day flagship smartphones have to offer. However the iOS 7 definitely promises to make better use of the display than what most other operating systems do with the respective displays. But for new iPhone users, especially the ones who are used to a larger display, the display of the Apple iPhone 5S just might not be good enough. For old time iPhone users however, the display will be good enough, albeit without any fancy new updates.
</p>
 

<h2 class=xyz1>Processor:</h2>
<p>
The processor is something that Apple has given a complete makeover to, with the Apple iPhone 5S. The shift to a 64 bit A7 processor is definitely a good move. The shift to the 64 bit is definitely to support more memory action. Furthermore it also helps support faster hardware performance. The A7 central processing unit allows seamless performance on a combination of both hardware and software. Furthermore, under exhaustive game plays as well as extreme processes, the Apple iPhone 5S delivers the fastest performance arguably faster than all other mobile processors today.
</p>

<h2 class=xyz1>Battery Life:</h2>
<p>
The battery on the Apple iPhone 5S carries more capacity, approximately a 9.35% more than the Apple iPhone 5, increasing the capacity from around 5.45 Wh to 5.96 Wh. The iPhone 5S definitely saves more power than the Apple iPhone 5 and transfers the same to providing a better performance. In terms of web browsing battery life, the period comes approximately to 8.5 odd hours, which is the highest amongst flagship smartphones in the high end market. However in terms of a regular cellular talktime battery life the Apple iPhone 5S performs at a less than competitive average of 9.3 hours. On a combinatorial usage however the Apple iPhone 5S provides one of the finest performances as far as the flagship smartphone market is concerned.
</p>
 

<h2 class=xyz1>Overall:</h2>
<p>
Concludingly the Apple iPhone 5S definitely provides tha Apple design aesthetics that we are so used to along with extremely powerful processing prowess and the utility of the new Touch id feature which is set to revolutionalize the way information and transactions are actuated in the new age. However apart from these all other updates are very nominal to be counted as groundbreaking updates.
