<H2 class=xyz1>The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>
If you are ready to spend more than Rs.40000 then apple iphone 5 is a good phone to go for with it's amazing features and performance.

When Apple launches a new product, it does not fail to surprise consumers. With the release of iPhone 5 there was a huge rush in its sales like no other product which clearly showed that iPhone 5 has outrun the rest of the smartphones in it's compitition of specs and features but also it's sales. iPhone 5 stands in the league of one of the best smartphones competing with Samsung Galaxy S4 and HTC One 
</p>

<h2 class=xyz1>Design and Build:</h2>
<p>
The iPhone 5 is a marvel of engineering. Apple stretched the screen from 3.5 inches to 4 inches while cramming in a higher-capacity battery and 4G LTE. The result is a design that weighs a mere 4 ounces and measures just 0.3 inches thick. Not only is the iPhone 5 the thinnest smartphone on the market, but it's about an ounce lighter than the iPhone 4S . The 5-inch Samsung Galaxy S4 and 4.7-inch HTC One weigh 4.6 and 5.04 ounces, respectively, so you're trading a larger screen for a heavier device. The HTC One's glass-and-aluminum body nearly rivals the iPhone 5 in terms of build quality, but the S4's polycarbonate shell feels cheaper. However, only the S4 lets you replace the battery among these three phones.
</p>
 

<h2 class=xyz1>Camera Performance:</h2>
<p>
Although it has the same 8-MP resolution as the 4S, the iPhone 5's camera captures photos 40 percent faster and offers better low-light performance. Like on the latest Android phones, you can also capture still images while recording video. The coolest new camera feature on the iPhone 5 is also available on the iPhone 4S with iOS 6: panoramic shooting. Apple makes it pretty easy to compose sweeping landscapes, although you have to have a steady hand. The resulting photo is a whopping 28 MP. When we compared all the top smartphones to see which one had the best camera, Apple's iPhone 5 snapped crisper, cleaner and more accurate photos than all of its competitors. Although its flash can be overpowering, the iPhone's camera performed the most consistently across the board, offering the most natural colors.
</p>
 

<h2 class=xyz1>Display:</h2>
<p>
Apple elongated the 3.5-inch Retina display of the iPhone 4S to 4 inches on the iPhone 5. At 1136 x 640 pixels, the iPhone 5 has the same pixel density as before, but makes room for more info on the screen, and added an extra row of app icons. In other words, there's less scrolling. The screen isn't just bigger, it's more beautiful. Boasting 44 percent greater color saturation, the new screen results in more vibrant-looking photos, games and more.
</p>
 

<h2 class=xyz1>Processor:</h2>
<p>
The A6 appears to be Apple's own in-house chip design. It's still a dual-core processor, like that in the 4S, but memory is double the iPhone 4S at 1GB. The A6 chip inside the iPhone 5 promises up to double the overall performance and graphics power of the 4S. In most benchmark tests, the iPhone 5 demonstrated a sizable advantage over its predecessor. The new A6 processor is up to twice as fast as the A5 in the iPhone 4S .
</p>

<h2 class=xyz1>Battery Life:</h2>
<p>
A 1440 mAh battery powers the Apple iPhone 5 giving you up to 8 hours of talktime and 225 hours of standby time. Compared to most of the high end smartphones this battery life is above average.
</p>
 

<h2 class=xyz1>Overall:</h2>
<p>
You get an amazingly thin and light design, strong performance and access to superior apps, all for a wallet-friendly monthly price.
