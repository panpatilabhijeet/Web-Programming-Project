<H2 class=xyz1>The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>
Still one of the biggest upgrades to iPhone with a big screen finally while still keeping the best in class performance and Camera makes the new iPhone 6 a great choice for die hard Apple fans and others alike.
</p>

<h2 class=xyz1>Design and Build:</h2>
<p>
The iPhone 6 looks nice on the eyes, it’s super thin at 6.9mm and weighs 129 grams which feels super light for a 4.7 inch phone. The phone has an all aluminium unibody and has rounded off edges compared to previous generation’s squared off edges. The phone does tend look a bit like an HTC One now though. The phone is so smooth all over that it’s actually lacking grip. The iPhone 6 is bigger than most other phones sporting a 4.7 inch screen, thanks to the customary home button and matching top. The thinness of the phone has one drawback, the camera lens is a bit protruding. The lens is Sapphire coated so it’s not susceptible to scratches, but it still feels a bit odd. The overall build quality of the phone is great.
</p>
 

<h2 class=xyz1>Camera Performance:</h2>
<p>
iPhone cameras have always been the best on the market for a long time now, that camera smartphones and iPhones go hand in hand. The iPhone 5S had a great camera and the 6 is much improved, and at the time of the phone’s release was the best and the fastest cameras on a smartphone. It is an 8MP camera, though the competition had already moved on to 13 MP sensors, Apple chose to stick with 8MP, and the results are great. It can click really fast, has slo-mo recording and great low light performance. The image processing is top notch, so even if pictures are clicked really fast, they come out great. The only downside is that because it is 8MP, it cannot record 4K videos.
</p>
 

<h2 class=xyz1>Display:</h2>
<p>
The iPhone 6 has a 4.7 inch 1334*750p IPS LCD display. The display on iPhones have always been great and this doesn’t fail in that department either; with awesome colors and brightness and great viewing angles. The pixel density remains the same as previous iPhones at 326ppi which isn’t bad at all. The phone was released with iOS 8 and pretty much there wasn’t anything that fully utilized this great display.
</p>
 

<h2 class=xyz1>Processor:</h2>
<p>
The iPhone 6 has a 1.4 GHz Apple A8 dual core chip and 1 GB RAM. Although it sounds so low on paper compared to competition, the phone performs like any other flagship out there, making these numbers insignificant and its argubably the best processor in market at the time of release regardless of what the numbers lead you to beleive. 
</p>
 
<h2 class=xyz1>Software:</h2>
<p>
If there's one thing apple has always gotten right its the software, its not everyones cup of tea with its focus on simiplicity at the cost of some basic fucntions that Android users enjoy. What it does well it does extremely well and keeps it simple while maintaing the astehtics. One of the reasons Apple users don't switch to other phones is the ease of using the software and how u are tied into the Apple Eco system making the swtich harder. 
</p>

<h2 class=xyz1>Battery Life:</h2>
<p>
The phone is super thin, so you can guess, the battery will be super thin as well. The iPhone 6 has an 1810 mAh battery. This might get you thinking, at a time when phones are sporting 3000-4000 mAh batteries, whether this is enough for even half a day of usage. But thanks to the A8 chip and iOS optimizations the phone actually gives an approx 10-15% extra battery life over the iPhone 5S. For heavy users the phone might not last a day, but for moderate users the phone should last a day, thanks to the extremely good standby of the phone.
</p>
 

<h2 class=xyz1>Overall:</h2>
<p>
The iPhone 6 is a great upgrade from the iPhone 5S, it has got a bigger screen, better camera, better battery life and a better processor to keep up with the rest of the flagships. It’s good to look at, but it’s kinda slippery in the hands. It’s super thin and light, but it still has a great build quality. The camera is among the best you can find in a smartphone although not the best anymore as others have improved.
