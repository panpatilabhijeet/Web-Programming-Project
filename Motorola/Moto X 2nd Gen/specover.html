<H2 class=xyz1>The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>
Still one of the best devices in the market at this price range. Thanks to Motorola's stock Android approach, which ensures fast updates and smooth and fast phone over all.
</p>

<h2 class=xyz1>Design and Build:</h2>
<p>
The phone is built along the same lines as its predecessor which is pretty nice. The back of the phone has changed a bit, and the standard rubber back needs no extra protection or cases. It is great to hold in hand despite its increase in size and has a really good grip thanks to the rubber back and curves. Moto has added back the front facing stereo speakers and it’s among the best speakers in any smartphones.
</p>
 

<h2 class=xyz1>Camera Performance:</h2>
<p>
This is one big change over the second gen Moto X, as the Moto X Style has a 21 MP Sony module, which is much better than the older one. Although it’s the best ever camera that a Motorola phone has ever had, it still falls short of the best ones available in market. The outdoor photography is decent to good but the lack of OIS shows when there isn’t adequate light around.
</p>
 

<h2 class=xyz1>Display:</h2>
<p>
This is one of the biggest improvements on the Moto X Style over the Moto X2. It sports a quad HD IPS LCD screen which is a significant change over the 1080p OLED display panel on its predecessor. the viewing angles are pretty good, bright and sharp, but sunlight visibility isn’t the best out there and doesn’t dim all that much in dark rooms either. The IPS display does fade a bit in comparison to its OLED counterparts aswell.
</p>
 

<h2 class=xyz1>Processor:</h2>
<p>
The phone is powered by the Snapdragon 808 and the Adreno 418 GPU chip and 3 gigs of RAM. This is a Moto flagship and it definitely doesn’t disappoint as one, the stock like OS, which can now be upgraded to Android 6.0 makes it run super smooth and multi tasking will be a breeze with the 3 gigs of RAM and light OS. Quad HD phones take a lot of power, but this phone runs really smooth and the stock android is one reason.
</p>
 

<h2 class=xyz1>Battery Life:</h2>
<p>
The battery is non-removable but the new and bigger 3000 mAh battery supports turbo charging which is always an awesome feature to have for quick recharges on the go. This along with an already good battery life which easily lasts a day makes this phone awesome on the battery front.
</p>
 

<h2 class=xyz1>Overall:</h2>
<p>
Barring the improvements to camera, battery and processor the phone is pretty much the same as its predecessor which is great. Stock OS and useful bits added by Moto make the software experience great, the camera is great and the battery is awesome. The best part of the phone is, even though it’s a flagship it costs way lesser than the rest of the flagships in the market. Although there are certain aspects where it falls off in comparison to the rest of the flagships, for the price the Moto X Style is being sold at, it’s definitely one of the best available
