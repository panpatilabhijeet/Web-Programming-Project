<H2 class=xyz1>The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>
Still one of the best buys at this budget even with a slightly weaker processor, Specially with great camera and top notch battery life. This is one half of the third generation of the Moto X phones, the Moto X style being the other. The Moto X play is the mid range version, but it still packs a punch.
</p>

<h2 class=xyz1>Design and Build:</h2>
<p>
The design is clean and simple and feels good in the hands even though it’s slightly thicker than most phones. The volume buttons on the side feel a bit cheap. The back cover is removable and swappable like most other Moto phones. The speaker is at the bottom which is not that great, but with headphones the phone will surprise you.
</p>
 

<h2 class=xyz1>Camera Performance:</h2>
<p>
The Moto X play has a 21 MP back camera and a 5 MP front camera. The back camera is claimed to one of the best cameras ever on a smartphone and yes it can be put right alongside the best smartphone cameras in the market right now. It performs really well in daylight conditions but the low light performance leaves much to be desired yet.  
</p>
 

<h2 class=xyz1>Display:</h2>
<p>
The display is a 5.5 inch full HD LCD panel which is great and among one of the best you can find on devices with LCD panels. The colors are pleasant to look at and feel balanced and works fine even with display brightness at half.
</p>
 

<h2 class=xyz1>Processor:</h2>
<p>
The Moto X play is powered by a Snapdragon 615 aided by the Adreno 405 and 2 gigs of RAM. This is more than enough to help the phone run super smooth thanks to the pure android experience Moto phones come with.
</p>
 

<h2 class=xyz1>Battery Life:</h2>
<p>
The Moto X Play comes with a massive 3630 mAh battery, which is one of the best features of this phone. It lasts a day of normal usage easily with quite a bit of juice to spare. Also the turbocharging feature is awesome, a quick recharge of 15 minutes can give you 8 hours of usage.
</p>
 

<h2 class=xyz1>Overall:</h2>
<p>
It’s a great phone for the price, it’s got a great camera, an amazing display and a really great battery life. The stock android experience is also a plus with Android 6.0 soon to be out. It’s got only IP52 rating which means it’s only splash proof and not really fully resistant to water.
