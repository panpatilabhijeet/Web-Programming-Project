<H2 class=xyz1>The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>
At the time of launch this would still be one of the best and fastest flagship devices that you can get your hands on with an added bonus of it being extremely sturdy also thanks to shatterproof glass along with all day battery life and top notch build quality should make this an ideal choice for anyone who wants an option of a semi rugged flagship device.
</p>

<h2 class=xyz1>Design and Build:</h2>
<p>
The design of the Moto X Force  follows the same design as most of the new Motorola phones including the X Style, But slightly bulkier to make room for the large battery with no real surprises on the design aspect as compared to other Motorola phones this year Including the Moto G 3rd Generation and Moto X play. 
</p>
 

<h2 class=xyz1>Camera Performance:</h2>
<p>
The Camera Sensor is the same as Moto X Style which again is a good Camera over all but not one of the best you can get in the market but will meet even most heavy users requirements without too much trouble.
</p>
 

<h2 class=xyz1>Display:</h2>
<p>
The Display on Moto X Force is a 5.4 inch Quad HD AMOLED Screen. Display should be crisp and colour reproduction should be great with deep blacks as always with AMOLED panels, which is a great advantage specically with Motorola phones thanks to thier on screen notification system when device is locked.
</p>
 

<h2 class=xyz1>Processor:</h2>
<p>
The processor is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 V2.1 processor. Same processor powering the flagships like Nexus 6p, ensures this device performs seamlessly. Furthermore thanks to stock based android with no skin and bloatware out of the box the phone is speedy and multitasking is should be a breeze even with  3GB RAM. Moreover the ?Adreno 430 GPU ensures that even the most graphic intensive games play on seamlessly and without any lags.
</p>
 

<h2 class=xyz1>Battery Life:</h2>
<p>
The battery has gotten a bump to 3760 mAh this year, which gives the Moto X Force a considerable boost compared to Moto X Style which is no slouch in performance.
</p>
 

<h2 class=xyz1>Overall:</h2>
<p>
Over all this seems like a great upgrade to the Moto X style and most importantly a strudy one at that where Motorola is claming the device is shatter proof and will take bumps and falls much better than any other flagship out there in the market right now which is something we have to wait and see. A device with smaller footprint and much larger battery with Motorola's great take on Android and timely update policy will ensure this is one of the best phones you can get right now but will be able to continue being that good with new flagships for 2016 on the horizon only time will tell.
